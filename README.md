The git provider for [go-semantic-release](https://github.com/go-semantic-release/semantic-release).

This plugin will make sure that the continuous integration environment
conditions are met. Namely that the release is happening on the
correct branch.

## Usage

To use this plugin you need to include the following block in your
`.semrelrc` file.

```json
{
    "plugins": {
        "provider": {
            "name": "git",
            // Options can be omitted if you want to use the defaults.
            // See the section on configuration below.
            "options": {
                // Put configuration options here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Authentication

#### Automatic

If you don't pick a specific authentication mechanism then an
authentication mechanism will be picked based on the URL of the Git
remote. Under the covers [go-git](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-git/go-git)
is responsible for determining how to perform this kind of
authentication.

#### Basic

Basic authentication uses a username and password pair to perform
authentication over HTTP/HTTPS.

For this method you'll need to set `auth_username` and `auth_password`.

#### SSH

SSH authentication uses an SSH private key to authenticate with the
Git remote ove ran SSH connection.

For this method you'll need to set `auth_username` and
`auth_private_key`. If your private key uses a password then you'll
also need to set `auth_password`.
